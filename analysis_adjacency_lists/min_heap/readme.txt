A min-heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is less than or equal to the values of its children. This characteristic ensures that the root node always contains the smallest element of the heap.

Here's a breakdown of what the main parts of the code are designed to do:

Reading Data: The code begins by reading integers from a file named "Heap.txt" and storing them in a vector called Heap. This vector is used to represent the heap.
HeapifyDown Function: This function is crucial for maintaining the min-heap property after a node in the heap has been altered. It ensures that if a node's value becomes greater than one of its children, the node is swapped downwards until the min-heap property is restored. The function works by:
Checking if a node has children.
Determining the smaller of the two children (if both exist).
Swapping the parent with the smaller child if the child is smaller than the parent.
Recursively adjusting subsequent nodes if necessary.
Operations on the Heap:
Finding Minimum: The code uses the min_element function to find and print the minimum value in the heap, which should be at the root (the first element after the dummy element at index 0).
Swapping Elements: It swaps the first and last elements of the heap.
Deleting the Last Element: The last element is removed, and then the heap is adjusted using HeapifyDown.
Output: After various operations, the heap is printed several times to show the state of the heap at different stages.
Error Handling: There is a check to ensure that the input file exists before proceeding with the heap operations.
