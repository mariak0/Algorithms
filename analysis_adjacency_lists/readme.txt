create a function g
create 2 vectors, nodeOutEdges and graphOutEdges
create 1 iterator
set up a while loop, INSIDE WHICH
record the values in nodeOutEdges
Using the iterator, we record values in graphOutEdges
record the size of graphOutEdges in a variable

call g in the main function, so that the values of the graph can be recorded
