The provided text outlines a program that operates in the following steps:

File Import and Error Handling: The program first attempts to import two files containing lists. If these files are not found, an error message is displayed.

Processing Lists:
The first list is saved into a vector called vector1 and its contents are printed.
The second list is saved into a vector called vector2 and its contents are also printed.
Merging and Sorting Lists:
A new vector, vector3, is created to hold a merged and sorted version of the two lists.
The merging process involves comparing elements of the two lists one-by-one, inserting the smaller element into vector3.
This process continues until all elements from both lists are included in vector3.
Binary Search Implementation: When a user types a value to search:
The program uses a binary search algorithm on vector3.
The list is split into halves, and depending on whether the searched number is greater or smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the corresponding half.
This is repeated until the program finds the number or concludes that the number does not exist within the list.
