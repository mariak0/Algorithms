FOR BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH IN THE GIVEN GRAPH, WE FOLLOW THE ALGORITHM.

The search begins from the root of the tree (the user is asked to provide it)
Adjacent nodes are explored
It is checked whether a node has been discovered
The search continues at higher levels
To accomplish this, we use the command bool *visited which indicates if a node has already been discovered and the command list<int> queue where nodes are stored. These actions are also analyzed in the code, in the form of comments.
